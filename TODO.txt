* area_sero_immunity.csv is no longer generated. Is this important? See all_pop_map.R
* The cost_benefit_(20|50).csv files ideally need to be generated from dhb_vacc.csv in dhbcensus.R. Currently they're generated from the .xlsx, which isn't optimal.
* It seems MMR[1-2]summary2006.txt etc. aren't optimal. Find where these are written maybe?
